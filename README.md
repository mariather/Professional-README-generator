  ## Description
  
  This dynamic command-line application is created using node.js. It creates a new readme file for the user/programmer's project. The user is prompted with a series of questions that they will have to fill out, such as the name of the project, description, instructions, etc.
  

  ## Usage

  When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions that you'll have to answer about your project.

  Once the app has your responses, it will generate the file by using the fs.writeFile function created on the index.js.
